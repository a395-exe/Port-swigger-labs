Lab: DOM XSS in innerHTML sink using source location.search
📌 Lab Level: Apprentice
📝 Description

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the blog search functionality. The application uses JavaScript’s innerHTML to insert unsanitized input from location.search directly into the page, making it vulnerable to XSS.

🎯 Goal

Exploit the vulnerability to trigger an alert() popup.

🔎 Analysis

The application takes user-controlled input from the search box (via location.search)

This value is written directly into the page using innerHTML

Since there’s no input sanitization or encoding, injecting malicious HTML/JS code becomes possible

💻 Exploitation

Go to the search box in the blog.

Enter the following payload:

<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>


Click Search.

The invalid image source (src=1) causes an error.

The onerror event is triggered.

alert(1) is executed, proving XSS.

✅ Result

The alert popup was successfully triggered.

This confirms DOM XSS via innerHTML sink.
